Development & DevOps
As part of a hands-on DevOps learning journey, the project is containerized using Docker, with both the frontend and backend running in separate containers managed via Docker Compose. The images are pushed to Docker Hub to streamline deployment.

To improve automation and scalability, GitHub Actions is being integrated to facilitate CI/CD, ensuring seamless updates to the application as it evolves. Additionally, testing is being introduced to maintain reliability as new features are added.

This is a work in progress, with continuous improvements and DevOps best practices being implemented along the way!
